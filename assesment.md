- Create two microservices for real time messages using websockets, and at least one demo subscriber.
### Functionality
1. The first service should listen for incoming messages through the websocket protocol and when a new one arrives, the message should be published into message queue
2. The second service should listen for incoming messages through the message queue and when a new message arrives, the message should be published to all the subscribers through the websocket protocol
### Other Requirements
- At least one of the services should have tests
- Make sure your code is well structured and maintainable (including tests)
- You can use frameworks and technologies by your choice, but the language for the microservices should be Javascript (node) or Go (or both).
- The source code should be hosted online using github (or similar service)
